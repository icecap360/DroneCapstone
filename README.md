This repo contains the source code and CAD designs for the Parking Lot Hawk.  
ParkingLotHawk is an aerial drone that will fly above the parking lot to gather information about slot availability and general parking lot status. The parking lot authorities will be able to access and visualize this information from an application on their Personal Computers (PCs). The parking lot authorities will command the ParkingLotHawk  only through an application running on their PC. From the PC application, the operator will be able to launch the drone, move the drone to a specific location, or land the drone. When given a location to investigate, the drone will autonomously fly toward the location without the Operator's input. During flight, the operator will receive a live video feed from the drone's camera, as well as other valuable parking lot information.
