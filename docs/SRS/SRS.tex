\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the project will be to design an aerial drone, called ParkingLotHawk, that can detect how many parking spots are available in any given parking lot. ParkingLotHawk can be operated by property personnel to allow drivers how many spots are available at a parking lot. ParkingLotHawk will over any parking lot designated by the user and will aggregate visual information and output the amount of parking spots available. Many parking lots today do not have this data and this data can be used for many reasons.  The data can be used by retailers to know how long customers stay at specific stores or location. This data can also be used for drivers to know if there are parking spots available in a specific location allowing for drivers to not waste time and resources in a full parking lot. 
\subsection{Scope}
The product specified in this SRS is about an autonomous aerial drone for helping parking lot operators understand the state of their parking lot. The product specified does not require the operator to manually control or move the drone, rather the requirement describes various autonomous flight modes. The specified drone shall support the ability to both create a path to reach is specified location, as well as create and follow a path to explore large parking lot sections autonomously. During flight, the specified drone shall transmit live information about the parking lot sections it detects. The completed product, a combination of the physical drone and any equipment/application intended to be kept by the parking lot operator to communicate with the drone, is called the ParkingLotHawk. A solution that implements the requirements will help parking lot authorities of outdoor lots quickly gain valuable information without requiring permanent solution, large monetary and time investments or complex training. 



\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}
\subsection{References}
\subsection{Overview}
The SRS is organized to follow the IEEE 1998 template. \nameref{sec:Intro} contains the purpose of the SRS as well as the scope of the product and the problem it solves. \nameref{sec:Desc}  refines the scope of the product further. It provides more detail about the products environment, primary functions, intended users, constraints and finally assumption. \nameref{sec:Req} contains a detailed description of all requirements, organized into sections for readability. Finally the appendix contains reflection regarding new knowledge and skills the team needs to create the specified product, along with approaches to how the team will acquire the knowledge. 
\section{Overall Description}
\label{sec:Desc}
General factors that affect the product and the requirements are described in the following subsections. A high-level overview of the product functions are also described (see \nameref{subsec:ProdFunc}). 
\subsection{Product Perspective}
The system specified is an independent and stand-alone parking lot tool. It does not fit into or interface with a larger system of parking lot and security technologies the operator may have available. 

The environment consists of an outdoor parking lot and the operator's PC. The operator's PC shall be running with Windows 10 or Windows 11.

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{subsec:ProdFunc}
This subsection describes the behaviour overview of the ParkingLotHawk by splitting its functionality into various interconnected states of operation. These states are further refined within Section \nameref{sec:funcReqs}. 
\subsubsection{Idle State}
\label{Idle State}
The product is powered on and communicating with the operator application, but all motors are turned off. 
\subsubsection{Hover State}
\label{Hover State}
The product maintains its current longitudinal and latitudinal position, and hovers at a pre-defined operator selected height. 
\subsubsection{Manual Location Move State}
\label{Manual Location Move State}
The product shall move to an operator specified location, and hover at a pre-defined operator selected height. Note that this height does not need to be the same as the height specified in the Hover State. 
\subsubsection{Autonomous Explore State}
\label{Autonomous Explore State}
The product shall autonomously explore within the current parking lot without operator input. 
\subsubsection{Configure State}
\label{Configure State}
During this state, the operator is able to define parameters of operation that are not configurable in other states. 
\subsubsection{Off State}
\label{Off State}
The product shall be unpowered and stops communication with the operator application. 
\subsubsection{Land State}
\label{Land State}
The product shall land at its initial launch location.
\subsubsection{Desired Location Error State}
\label{Desired Location Error State}
This error state occurs when the operator specifies an invalid desired position and shall provide the appropriate error message to the operator. 
\subsubsection{No Parking Lot Detected Error State}
\label{No Parking Lot Detected Error State}
This error state occurs when the product does not detect a valid parking lot, and shall provide the appropriate error message to the operator.
\subsubsection{Malfunction State}
\label{Malfunction State}
This error state occurs when an internal/external malfunction occurs in such a way that nominal performance is not possible. The resulting action by the product will be further specified within Section \nameref{sec:funcReqs}. 



\subsection{User characteristics}
The stakeholders are Dr. Spencer Smith, the MECHTRON 4TB6 teaching assistants, property managers, security personnel and anyone who is an active driver. All demographics mentioned would find the data of the ParkingLotHawk useful. The knowledge expected for using the ParkingLotHawk is to be able to understand how to use a computer and how to switch a device on and off. The user will need to turn the drone on and place it close to a parking lot. The user will also need to send an ON command using a computer that will be sent to the drone using radio communication. The ParkingLotHawk is made mindful of the community, therefore, no air or noise pollution will occur, and no invasion of privacy will ensue.
\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:Constraints}
The purpose of the system is to provide parking spots availability to property managers and/or security personnel and this information could be relayed to customers or guests of a property. As the user can come from a non-technical background, the constrain on the usability of the product should be considered. The system will be used using radio communication from a computer and turned on and off using one button. Radio communication can only work within about 2 km from one point to the other. The project constraint present is a maximum budget of \$ 750.  Canadian regulatory policy does not allow for drone flight within 1 nautical mile (about 2 km) from heliports and 3 nautical miles (5.6 km) from airports. If the drone weighs over 25 kg the team will need to get special permission from Transport Canada before flying.
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sec:Assumptions}
The assumptions of the project are:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Functional Autopilot Software
  \item Long lasting battery

\end{itemize}

The dependencies of the project are:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Operator does not fly the drone exceeding a specified amount of time
  \item Birds do not interfere with the drone
  \item Operator has a Windows 10 or 11 OS
  \item Parking lot lines are visible
  \item Operation done under non-inclement weather 



\end{itemize}
\section{Specific requirements }

\section{Supporting information}
\subsection{Appendixes}
\subsubsection{Appendix A: Reflection}
Although the team has a solid education in the foundation in Mechatronics, they lack practical experience in building drones and robots in general. The knowledge the team currently does not have is identified in the table below. Each discipline of knowledge was assigned to a specific team members who would become the expert in the subject. They may use any resources to gain the knowledge, such as books, blogs, YouTube videos, and other websites available to them. 

The team has also defined what it means to be an expert in their domain: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In depth understanding of how the component works physically (if applicable). 
    \item Proper reasoning as to why specific component/firmware was chosen.
    \item In depth understanding of the key parameters and specifications of the product/firmware.
    \item In depth understanding of the inputs and outputs to the domain. 
    \item In depth understanding of the integration of the domain into the project. 
\end{itemize}

For many of the technical domains, the team has opted to partake in a dual-expert system where two experts are present for the domain. This ensures that in the absence of an expert, the effects on the team are minimized. Furthermore, this promotes collaboration between the experts during their research of their domain. Git, programming languages and Linux are already well understood by team members.
