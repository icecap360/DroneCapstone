\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the project will be to design an aerial drone, called ParkingLotHawk, that can detect how many parking spots are available in any given parking lot. ParkingLotHawk can be operated by property personnel to communicate to drivers on how many spots are available at a parking lot. ParkingLotHawk will explore over any parking lot designated by the user and will aggregate visual information and output the amount of parking spots available. Many parking lots today do not have this data and this data can be used for many reasons. The data can be used by retailers to know how long customers stay at specific stores or location. This data can also be used for drivers to know if there are parking spots available in a specific location allowing for drivers to not waste time and resources in a full parking lot. 
\subsection{Scope}
The product specified in this SRS \ref{DefTable} is about an autonomous aerial drone for helping parking lot operators understand the state of their parking lot. The product specified does not require the operator to manually control or move the drone, rather the requirement describes various autonomous flight modes. The specified drone shall support the ability to both create a path to reach its specified location, as well as create and follow a path to explore large parking lot sections autonomously. During flight, the specified drone shall transmit live information about the parking lot sections it detects. The completed product, a combination of the physical drone and any equipment/application intended to be kept by the parking lot operator to communicate with the drone, is called the ParkingLotHawk. A solution that implements the requirements will help parking lot authorities of outdoor lots quickly gain valuable information without requiring permanent solution, large monetary and time investments, or complex training.

It provides more detail about the products environment, primary functions, intended users, constraints, and finally assumptions. \nameref{sec:Req} contains a detailed description of all requirements, organized into sections for readability. Finally, the \nameref{appendix} contains \nameref{appendixa} regarding new knowledge and skills the team needs to create the specified product, along with approaches to how the team will acquire the knowledge. The \nameref{appendixb}  also contains the formal transition tables between the states of the finite state machine which will be later introduced within \nameref{subsec:ProdFunc}.
\section{Overall Description}
\label{sec:Desc}
General factors that affect the product and the requirements are described in the following subsections. A high-level overview of the product functions are also described (see \nameref{subsec:ProdFunc}). 
\subsection{Product Perspective}
The system specified is an independent and stand-alone parking lot tool. It does not fit into or interface with a larger system of parking lot and security technologies the operator may have available. 

The environment consists of an outdoor parking lot and the operator's PC. The operator's PC shall be operating with Windows 10 or Windows 11.

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{subsec:ProdFunc}
This subsection describes the behaviour overview of the ParkingLotHawk by splitting its functionality into various interconnected states of operation. These states are shown within the \nameref{InfFSM} and are further refined within \nameref{sec:funcReqs}. 
\subsubsection{Idle State}
\label{Idle State}
The product is powered on and communicating with the operator application, but all motors are turned off. 
\subsubsection{Hover State}
\label{Hover State}
The product maintains its current longitudinal and latitudinal position, and hovers at a pre-defined operator selected height. 
\subsubsection{Autonomous Move State}
\label{Autonomous Move State}
If the Operator requests to move to a specific location within the parking lot, the product shall move to that location and hover at a pre-defined operator-selected height. Note that this height does not need to be the same as the height specified in the Hover State. 
\subsubsection{Compulsive Move State}
\label{Compulsive Move State}
If the Operator requests to move to a location, the product shall move to that location regardless of if it is within the parking lot. One at that location the product shall hover at a pre-defined operator-selected height. Note that this height does not need to be the same as the height specified in the Hover State. 
\subsubsection{Autonomous Explore State}
\label{Autonomous Explore State}
The product shall autonomously explore within the current parking lot without operator input. 
\subsubsection{Configure State}
\label{Configure State}
During this state, the operator is able to define parameters of operation that are not configurable in other states. 
\subsubsection{Off State}
\label{Off State}
The product shall be unpowered and stops communication with the operator application. 
\subsubsection{Land State}
\label{Land State}
The product shall land at its initial launch location.
\subsubsection{Desired Location Error State}
\label{Desired Location Error State}
This error state occurs when the operator specifies an invalid desired position and shall provide the appropriate error message to the operator. 
\subsubsection{No Parking Lot Detected Error State}
\label{No Parking Lot Detected Error State}
This error state occurs when the product does not detect a valid parking lot, and shall provide the appropriate error message to the operator.
\subsubsection{Malfunction State}
\label{Malfunction State}
This error state occurs when an internal/external malfunction occurs in such a way that nominal performance is not possible. The resulting action by the product will be further specified within \nameref{sec:funcReqs}. 
\subsubsection{Communication Lost State}
\label{Communication Lost State}
This error state occurs when the product has lost connection or has a very weak connection so the Operator's Application, and shall provide the appropriate error message to the operator.
\subsubsection{Arm State}
\label{Arm State}
During this state the drone shall arm and remain armed.
\subsubsection{Takeoff State}
\label{Takeoff State}
During this state, the vehicle shall take off the ground towards m\_MaxHoverHeight.

The normal modes of operation include the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Idle State
  \item Hover State
  \item Autonomous Move State
  \item Compulsive Move State
  \item Autonomous Explore State
  \item Configure State
  \item Off State
  \item Arm State
  \item Takeoff State
\end{itemize}
The flight modes of operation \label{flightModes} include the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hover State
  \item Takeoff State
  \item Autonomous Move State
  \item Compulsive Autonomous Move
  \item Autonomous Explore State
   \item No Parking Lot Detected Error State
   \item Desired Location Out of Bounds Error State
\end{itemize}
With the exception of the Configure State and Off State, the product shall update continuously update c\_CurrentView and c\_OccupancyMap for the operator. These requirements are further refined within \nameref{sec:funcReqs}. 

The error modes are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Desired Location Error State
    \item No Parking Lot Detected Error State
    \item Malfunction State
    \item Communication Lost State
\end{itemize}
These modes are used to handle errors either from the operator, or internally from the product. 

The behaviour overview of the product is described below, with each directional arrow representing a transition between states:

  \label{InfFSM}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User characteristics}
The stakeholders are Dr. Spencer Smith, the MECHTRON 4TB6 teaching assistants, parking lot authorities \ref{DefTable}, parking lot operators, and visitors of the parking lot. All demographics mentioned would find the data of the ParkingLotHawk useful. There is no technical or software knowledge expected for users of the ParkingLotHawk. The user will need to turn the drone on and place it close to a parking lot.  The ParkingLotHawk is made mindful of the societhttps://www.overleaf.com/project/633da9268221bf16bb108961y and community and its health impacts; therefore, little to no air or noise pollution shall occur, and no invasion of privacy shall ensue.
\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:Constraints}
The purpose of the system is to provide parking lot information to parking lot operators, who in turn could use that information to decrease the amount of time visitors spend to find a parking spot. As the user can come from a non-technical background, the constraints on the usability of the product should be considered. If the system chooses to use radio communication between the operator's laptop and the product, it must abide by national radio frequency regulations of 2.4MHz. Furthermore, radio communication can only work within approximately 2 km from one point to the other while still abiding by the national regulations. The project constraint present is a maximum budget of \$ 750.  Canadian regulatory policy does not allow for drone flight within 1 nautical mile (about 2 km) from heliports and 3 nautical miles (5.6 km) from airports\cite{canada_flying_2020}. If the drone weighs over 25 kg, the team will need to get special permission from Transport Canada before flying the drone\cite{canada_find_2021}; therefore, the product should be under a weight of 25kg to support widespread adoption.
\subsection{Assumptions}
\label{sec:Assumptions}
The assumptions of the project are:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Operator does not fly the drone exceeding a specified amount of time.
  \item Birds do not interfere with the drone.
  \item Operator's PC has a Windows 10 or 11 OS.
  \item Parking lot lines are visible to the naked eye.
  \item Operation done under non-inclement weather\ref{DefTable}. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
The Phase in Plan is composed of three main releases:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase I: Proof of Concept - November 14, 2022
    \item Phase II: Revision 0 (Minimal Viable Product (MVP) ) - February 6, 2023 
    \item Phase III: Revision 1 - March 27, 2023
\end{itemize}
Each requirement will then be assigned to one of these phases within \nameref{sec:Req}, indicated by their Phase.

\label{STA_000}
\begin{tabular}{ | m{3cm} | m{11cm} | } 

\hline
Description & The product shall implement an Idle state. During this state, the solution is powered on but motors are stationary. This requirement is a refinement of the \nameref{Idle State}, and further refined by \nameref{PERF_007}, \nameref{SAFE_001}, \nameref{SAFE_003}, and \nameref{USE_003}. \\
\hline
Rationale & This state is used to ensure that the operator can safely hold the drone and access the mechanical switch that controls m\_PowerOn. \\

\begin{center}
\caption {STA\_001} 
\label{STA_001}
\begin{tabular}{ | m{3cm} | m{11cm} | }
\hline
Description & The product shall implement a Hover State. During this state, the solution shall fly to and hover at a height of i\_MaxHoverHeight. The drone shall keep the same lateral location it is currently at. The drone cannot transition to another flight state until it has reached a height of i\_MaxHoverHeight. This requirement is a refinement of the \nameref{Hover State} and is further refined by \nameref{PERF_002}, \nameref{PERF_004}, \nameref{PERF_005}, \nameref{PERF_006}, \nameref{PERF_007}, \nameref{SAFE_001}, \nameref{SAFE_003}, and \nameref{USE_003}. \\
\hline
Rationale & This state is used for when the product is waiting for further operator commands. Hover height is selected to be i\_MaxHoverHeight, so that the drone can see as much of the parking lot section as it can. This makes the transition to \nameref{Autonomous Explore State} more likely.
The drone cannot exit the Hover state until it reaches i\_MaxHoverHeight. This feature is added to ensure that the drone moves does not move laterally until it has sufficient height. during this state. For example, if the drone is just launching from the ground, it is unsafe for the drone to transition to the \nameref{Autonomous Explore State} and move laterally (as it could collide with an object).    \\

Phase & II \\
\hline
Likely to Change & No. This requirement is a key feature of the MVP, and is required in order to gather any useful information to the operator. \\

Description & The product shall implement an Autonomous Move State. During this state, the drone moves to the m\_DesiredUserLoc if it is within the parking lot, and hovers at that location with height i\_DesiredHoverHeight. This requirement is a refinement of the \nameref{Autonomous Move State} and is further refined by \nameref{PERF_003}, \nameref{PERF_004}, \nameref{PERF_006}, \nameref{PERF_007}, \nameref{SAFE_001}, \nameref{SAFE_003}, \nameref{USE_003}, and \nameref{PERF_008}. \\

\label{appendix}
\subsubsection{Appendix A: Reflection}
\label{appendixa}
Although the team has a solid education in the foundation in Mechatronics, they lack practical experience in building drones and robots in general. The knowledge the team currently does not have is identified in \nameref{tab:DomainExp}. Each discipline of knowledge was assigned to a specific team members who would become the expert in the subject. They may use any resources to gain the knowledge, such as books, blogs, YouTube videos, and other websites available to them. 

The team has also defined what it means to be an expert in their domain: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In depth understanding of how the component works physically (if applicable). 
    \item Proper reasoning as to why specific component/firmware was chosen.
    \item In depth understanding of the key parameters and specifications of the product/firmware.
    \item In depth understanding of the inputs and outputs to the domain. 
    \item In depth understanding of the integration of the domain into the project. 
\end{itemize}

For many of the technical domains, the team has opted to partake in a dual-expert system where two experts are present for the domain. This ensures that in the absence of an expert, the effects on the team are minimized. Furthermore, this promotes collaboration between the experts during their research of their domain. Git, programming languages and Linux are already well understood by team members.
