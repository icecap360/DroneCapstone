\section{Design Verification}
\label{sec:designVerification}
As outlined within the \nameref{vnvPlan}, multiple methods are utilized to verify the SRS and design to ensure that the design is meeting the requirements. This is done by verifying the SRS, the design, and then the VnV Plan itself.

\subsection{SRS Verification}
\label{subsec:srsVerification}
The Finite State Machine (FSM) outlined within the Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) has been formally verified through the maintenance of a decision table, located within \nameref{appendixb}. Through informal verification, the team has conducted a guided review with a technical external party, using the process outlined within the \nameref{SRSVerification}. All Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs) mentioned by the external party are present within the SRS, with additional NFRs not mentioned by the external party. These NFRs were discussed to determine if they are required, and no changes were made to the SRS as a result. 

The checklist outlined within the \nameref{SRS_Checklist} has also been conducted internally within the team and all points have been met. Furthermore, a code review has been conducted within the team to recreate the FSM from just the code. The resulting FSM matches the one located within \nameref{appendixb}, thus ensuring that the FSM is correctly implemented.

\subsection{Design Verification}
\label{subsec:designVerification}
The Design Verification consists of a guided review with and external party, using the checklist provided within the \nameref{Design1_Checklist} as a reference. The main purpose is to ensure that all Functional Requirements (FRs) have been met. The results of the review can be found in \nameref{tab:extDesignVerification}. For conciseness, points that have been met and has no additional feedback are excluded in the results.

\hline
Criteria & Feedback & Team Response \\ 
\hline
The condition i\_MinHoverHeight <= i\_DesiredHoverHeight <= i\_MaxHoverHeight shall always be true. & 
    This requirement is not explicitly associated with a specific module or state, whether it's the GUI module or the Configure State. Thus, no module is currently verifying this condition. &
    The condition will be verified within the Configure State when the values are updated by the user. \\ 
\hline
The product shall be shall highlight non-occupied parking slots on the operator's display (update c\_CurrentView). &
    There is no window to show the c\_currentView. Only the live camera output is visible. &
    The new window will be added into the GUI module. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

A more detailed internal review has also been conducted using \nameref{Design2_Checklist}, with the results in \nameref{tab:intDesignVerification}.

\begin{tabular}{ | m{7.7cm} | m{7.7cm} | } 
\hline
Criteria & Feedback \\ 
\hline
Does the design implement all the performance requirements listed below? & 
    These requirements have not been fully tested in the real world. However, all performance requirements have been tested within a Software in The Loop (SITL) environment and has met all requirements. \\ 
\hline
The product shall be mechanically waterproof, to the point it can sustain a light drizzle for 1 minute of operation while still performing within the requirements. &
    The product has not been explicitly tested within the rain for operation, but design considerations have been made to mechanically isolate the electronic components. The product is capable of aerial flight during light snow flurries and takeoff/landing in 5cm+ of frozen snow. \\
\hline
The product shall be able to operate and provide data to the operator for > 5 minutes without the need to recharge. &
    The product is currently capable of only 3.5 minutes of flight outdoors. However, this degradation in battery capacity is due to the cold weather during testing (-5\degree C and below) and its negative impact on LiPo battery performance. \\

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}
\label{subsec:vnvVerification}

The VnV Plan has been verified through a review process with an external Capstone group, using the  \nameref{VnV_Checklist}. All points have been met. However, the external party has noted that there are too many test cases given the flight time of 5 minutes, thus making the tests difficult to execute and would require multiple batteries to be swapped and recharged. Therefore, the team will consider using a larger battery capacity for future iterations.


\section{System Testing}
\label{sec:SystemTesting}

This section contains the results of the System Tests outlined within \nameref{systemTest}. Detailed test procedures can be found within the Test Case Reference provided within the results. Each test case is then either evaluated as a Pass, Principally Pass, Partially Pass, or Fail, as defined within \nameref{sec:defAbrev}. Some test cases use the SITL environment as defined within \nameref{subsec:sitl}.

\subsection{Flight Dynamics}

\hline
Procedure & Fly the drone indoors in its hovering state for a minute. \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & The drone should reach its hover height within 25 seconds, and hover within 0.5m of the requested hovering height. The drone should also stay within 1.5m of the launch location.  \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & The drone was flown outdoors using an RC Controller in a guided control mode(i.e. the Parking Lot Hawk which autonomously flies the drone was not used). Within this mode, altitude and location are maintained when no user inputs are given. It successfully flew for 60 seconds and took off in less than 25 seconds. No additional movement commands were sent after takeoff, and the drone maintained a 1.5m radius around the launch location, and height was maintained within 0.5m.  \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Pass. The purpose of this test was to verify that the drone is mechanically and electrically able to take off and maintain flight in a simple no-wind indoor scenario. By hovering outdoors (with wind gusts) for 60 seconds, the essence of the test was verified on a more difficult scenario.  \\

Procedure & Attempt to set the height parameters of the drone to invalid values. First, try to set them to be below the minimum height requirement (7m), then try to set the maximum hover height to be less than the minimum hover height.  \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & The drone should prevent the user from entering invalid height parameters both times, and return an error that the height parameters are invalid.   \\

\hline
Procedure & Attempt to take off and hover the drone at the minimum safe hover height (7m) for 60 seconds. After the test, land the drone by asserting m\_land. \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & The drone should launch to 7m within 25 seconds, hover within 0.5m of the 7m height, and laterally stay within 1.5m of the launch location.   \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within SITL, the drone successfully takes off to 7m. It successfully remains within the height and lateral requirements for the time period specified. The test was never performed with the physical drone in an outdoor environment.  \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Partially Pass. One of the purposes of the test was to verify operation states (such as configure, hover, and land). The SITL test verified the operation states. The test's primary purpose was to verify that the drone's mechanical design, electrical design, and autonomous flight software can fly and land the drone from a height of 7m. The product failed to fulfill the primary purpose of this test. The cause of failure is that the autonomous flight software has not yet been fully tuned, thus autonomous flight cannot be performed. See \nameref{tab:STCR_001} for a test of the product's mechanical and electrical design.  \\

\hline
Procedure & While in a flight state, set the desired location to be 20m diagonally forward-right, and enter the compulsive move state (by asserting m\_CompulsiveMove).    \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & The drone should fly toward the desired location, traveling at least 4 m/sec. A live display of the drone's location and a visual trace of the drone's past location should be visible in the GUI. After reaching the desired location, the drone should remain within 1.5m of the desired location.    \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within SITL, the drone successfully flies in a straight line path to the desired location, while satisfying the height, speed, and lateral position requirements. The test was never performed with the physical drone in an outdoor environment. \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Partially Pass. One of the purposes of the test was to verify the compulsive move operation states. The SITL test verifies that operation state. The test's primary purpose however was to verify that the drone's mechanical design, electrical design, and autonomous flight software can laterally fly the drone and fly faster than the 4 m/sec average speed requirement. The product failed to fulfill the primary purpose of this test. The cause of failure is that the autonomous flight software has not yet been fully tuned, thus autonomous flight cannot be performed. \\

Procedure &  Fly the drone in any flying state.  \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & After a sufficiently long time (at least 3.5 minutes), when the battery capacity remaining is less than 1.5 minutes, the drone will enter the Malfunction state. Upon entering the malfunction state, the drone shall log an error message and land itself at its original launch location.   \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within the SITL, the drone enters the Malfunction state after 6 minutes of flight. The battery capacity remaining at his point is 20\% (1.5 minutes). The drone logs a low battery message and lands at its launch location. The test was never performed with the physical drone in an outdoor environment. \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Partially Pass. The primary purpose of the test was to verify the Malfunction state and the low battery transitions. The SITL test verifies the Malfunction state and the low battery transition. The test's secondary purpose however was to verify that the drone's mechanical design and electrical design allow a battery life of flight time of at least 3.5 minutes. The product failed to fulfill the secondary purpose of this test. The cause of failure is that the autonomous flight software has not yet been fully tuned, thus autonomous flight cannot be performed. \\

Procedure & During any of the flight states, disconnect the Operator's PC from the Wifi communication network.     \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & The drone should log an error message, return an unhealthy status, and enter the communication lost state.   \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within SITL, the drone enters the Communication Lost state and lands upon the communication network being disconnected. A log message and unhealthy status is seen on the Operator's PC. While testing on the drone but with propellers disconnected and in a flight state, it is observed that the drone enters the Communication Lost state.  \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Principally Pass. The purpose of this test was to verify the Communication Lost state. The operation of the communication lost state was verified in SITL, and the transition into the state was verified using the stationary drone test. Thus the purpose of this test was accomplished. The purpose of this test did not mention any flight dynamics testing, as there are other test cases to verify landing dynamics (\nameref{tab:STCR_003}), thus a real-life flight is not necessary.   \\

Expected Result & The drone should log an error message, return an unhealthy status, and enter the communication lost state.   \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within SITL, the drone enters the Communication Lost state and lands upon the application being closed. A log message and unhealthy status were seen on the Operator's PC. While testing on the drone but with propellers disconnected and in a flight state, it is observed that the drone enters the Communication Lost state.  \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Principally Pass. The purpose of this test was to verify that the drone correctly transitions to the Communication Lost state when the Parking Lot Hawk application is closed, and verify the operation of the Communication Lost state. The operation of the communication lost state was verified in SITL, and the transition into the state was verified using the stationary drone test. Thus the purpose of this test was accomplished. The purpose of this test did not mention any flight dynamics testing, as there are other test cases to verify landing dynamics (\nameref{tab:STCR_003}), thus a real-life flight is not necessary.   \\

Procedure & Fly the drone forward until Communication is lost, which can be done by choosing a far away desired location and using Compulsive Move.   \\
\hline
Expected Result & Upon communication being lost, the drone should enter the Communication Lost state and fly back toward the launch location. While flying back the drone should eventually reconnect to the Operator's PC, and enter the Hover state.    \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & The test was performed with the propellers disconnected, and a person holding and walking with the drone away. The drone lost communication at about 200m. When the tester walked back, the drone reconnected and entered the Hover state. 

The test was not performed in proper flight as the drone has not yet been tuned for autonomous flight. The test could not be performed in SITL either, as even at large distances the simulated drone would not lose connection.  \\
\hline
Result Analysis & Partially Pass. The primary purpose of the test was to stress test the strength of the communication network and the ability of the drone to disconnect and reconnect. Another reason for the test is to verify transitions to and from Communication Lost state as well as its operation. Both purposes were fulfilled by the manual walking with the drone test. Another purpose of the test case was to elucidate how performance degrades with the drone far away. This purpose cannot be tested until the drone flies autonomously in the real physical world.  \\

Procedure & Change m\_DesiredUserLocation to a location outside of the parking lot. Assert m\_CompulsiveMove to make the drone move to the desired location. A prompt will open asking if the user is sure they want the drone to move a location outside of a parking lot, respond with "OK". \\
\hline
Expected Result & When the user attempts to move to an invalid location, the ParkingLotHawk application running on the Operator's PC should display a prompt, indicating that the desired location is invalid. When the user presses "OK", indicating they still want to fly to the location, the drone should fly toward the desired location of the user.  \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within SITL, the drone gave a prompt informing the user the requested location is not within a parking lot. Upon selecting "Yes", the drone flied towards the requested location. The test was not performed in real life as the drone is still not tuned for autonomous flight.  \\
\hline
Result Analysis & Principally Pass. The purpose of the test was to verify the ability of the drone to prompt the user when the requested location is detected as invalid, this behavior was verified by the SITL test.

Expected Result & The first attempt to Autonomously Explore the parking lot should fail and the drone should enter the No Parking Lot Detected Error state. During this state, the drone should continuously hover, a descriptive error message should appear in c\_Log, and c\_UserError should change to No_Lot_Detected_State. During the Compulsive Move state, c_UserError should be None. The second attempt to enter the Autonomous Explore state should succeed.   \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Within SITL, the first attempt to enter the Autonomous Explore state failed. The drone entered the No Parking Lot Error state when the desired location was not within a parking lot. During the No Parking Lot Detected state, the drone was hovering and an error message is seen in c\_Log, and c\_UserError is No_Lot_Detected_State. During the Compulsive Move state, c_UserError changed to None. The second attempt to enter the Autonomous Explore succeeded. The test was not performed in real life.  \\

Procedure &  Curate a dataset of at least 50 images of varying weather, lighting, and height conditions (details in the full test case specification). Use the dataset to profile the performance of the algorithm (FPS) on the Raspberry Pi hardware. Also, use the dataset to estimate the classifier's accuracy.  \\ 
\hline
Expected Result & The algorithm processes at least 0.5 frames per second on the Raspberry Pi Hardware. Given the simplicity of the classification task, an accuracy of 80\% for assigning the center pixel correctly to either parking lot, nature, or occupied is required. \\ 
\hline
Actual Result & Among over 50 samples, the classifier takes on average 0.478 seconds with a standard deviation 0.048 sec, to process one frame. The maximum time to process a single frame was 0.68 sec. The histogram of time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:occClassifierPerf}. 


The overall accuracy of the classifier was 51\%. The classifier performed well on the nature classification task but performed poorly on classifying parking lots in sunny conditions. The classifier really struggled to correctly predict the center pixel as being occupied by some obstacle, scoring just 24\%. Further analysis revealed that the obstacles were often confused with parking lots. Table \ref{tab:OccClassifierSummary} breaks down the results by object and weather type. Samples of the images tested are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sampleImages}. \\ 
\hline
Result Analysis & Fail. The classifier performs at a sufficient speed to satisfy the 0.5 FPS requirement. However, the accuracy of the classifier was well below the expected 80\%, and is not fit for being used by the user. \\

Result Analysis & Fail, the algorithm is well below the 80\% desired. From Figure \ref{fig:segAccuracy}, it can be seen that certain images have much poorer accuracy, such as image 3. The segmented result of image 3 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:segShadow}. The lower half of the image is covered by a shadow from the building, producing a much darker ground surface.

\section{Reflection}
\subsection{Project Assessment}
The current quality of the project is inadequate, as the MVP still has yet to be developed. In particular the autonomous flight software not being tuned to fly autonomously is preventing the project from reaching the MVP milestone. However, there has been significant development on meeting some stretch goals, especially those concerned with visual perception. These are shown within \nameref{subsec:visionApp}. 

The most important area of improvement is tuning the flight controller so the drone can attain autonomous flight. Areas such as mechanical, electrical, software infrastructure, and communication network design are developed thoroughly and are fully tested. Therefore, once the flight controller is sufficiently tuned, many of the remaining features will be implemented. Another area of improvement are the visual perception features, in particular improving functionality in sunny weather conditions. The low performance is demonstrated within \nameref{tab:OccClassifierSummary}.

\subsection{Changes Due to Testing}
\label{subsec:changesFromTesting}

The documentation review yielded several important changes that need to be made. Improvements to the SRS included specifying which module implements the height requirement, and requirements need to be written for the design decision to use predownloaded satellite imagery. This includes specifying where satellite imagery is stored on the Operator's PC, specifying how the user can specify a location to download satellite imagery, and what happens when the drone flies in an area without predownloaded satalite imagery. Furthermore, due to changes in design, the definition of c\_CurrentView needs to be changed to be just the live camera view without annotations as opposed to an annotated camera stream. Changes to the FSM are also required as the state machine did not account for when software algorithm modules fail to execute, in addition to the changes made to the compulsive/autonomous move state. The VnV Plan survey also revealed that multiple spare batteries, or larger capacity batteries, should be purchased to facilitate the testing process.

The test cases also revealed issues with the current implementation. For example a visual trace of the drone's previous path in the past 10 seconds is not visible in the GUI, and the accuracy of the visual perception algorithm (both segmentation and classification) is poor and not robust, thus should be improved.

\section{Automated Testing}

Many automated testing tools were used to automate the testing and verification process, as outlined within the \nameref{automatedVerificationTools}. For consistency within the team, VS Code is used as the Integrated Development Environment, with Pylint and clang-tidy for Python and C++ linters respectively. As outlined within \nameref{systemTest} and \nameref{unitTest}, many of the test cases are automatic and are conducted through the UnitTest framework. A list of these automatic test cases are included in Table \ref{tab:automatedTestCases}. In addition to unit testing frameworks, a custom evaluation tool is used to automatically execute and generate metrics for the Vision App test cases, such as within \nameref{tab:OccClassifierSummary}.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

Verification and Validation (VnV) is a critical process in software development which involves assessing the quality and correctness of the software. The VnV plan outlines the strategies and methodologies that will be employed to verify and validate the software. However, in practice, there may be differences between the VnV plan and the actual VnV activities conducted. These differences may result from unforeseen circumstances, changes in requirements, or other factors.

Many of the test cases involving flight were done within the SITL environment as opposed to with the physical drone. This is due to the incomplete tuning process of the drone, thus preventing autonomous flight. The main cause for the incomplete tuning is due to the extensive damage incurred during testing, and the additional time required to repair and rebuild the drone. However, parallel development continued on the software allowing for nearly all test cases to be tested at least within the SITL environment. Although the extent of damage incurred could not be predicted, additional time could be allocated within the project scheduling for testing to allow a larger buffer for unexpected circumstances.

Another source of change in the VnV Plan is due to the changing requirements, as mentioned within \nameref{subsec:changesFromTesting}. An example would be the change in definition of c\_CurrentView from being an annotated camera stream to an unoannotated one, which was a result of a design change made to simplify the communication infrastructure. Although such changes to the requirements could not be predicted precisely, certain requirements are labeled as requirements likely to change. Thus, test cases involving these requirements could be made with flexibility in mind such that changing the requirement would only require a small change within the test case procedure or expected result.

In conclusion, deviations from the VnV plan are common in software development projects. These deviations may result from changes in requirements, unexpected issues, or other factors. To anticipate changes and minimize the impact of these deviations, project managers must engage in continuous monitoring and evaluation of the development process, regularly review the VnV plan, and remain open to feedback from team members, stakeholders, and end-users.
