\section{General Information}

The VnV (Verification and Validation) Plan for the ParkingLotHawk produces a set of test cases to help verify our project and have it reviewed through a checklist to determine any inconsistencies.

\wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the Verification and Validation plan}

\subsection{Summary}

The project involves the operation of a drone through manual and automated instructions within a parking lot, thus involving a variety of tests that focus on the physical and virtual constraints of the project. To achieve the optimal solution to the project, there will be a variety of test cases that will be used by the team in the process of building the drone and creating the intended software for its operation. These test cases involve the use of static test, dynamic test, unit test and stress test. The following format will be used for the previously mentioned testing techniques to help during the process of testing:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{3cm} m{11cm}|}
\hline &\\
     \textbf{Title:} & The description for the test \\&\\
     \textbf{Test ID:} & Test number \\&\\
     \textbf{Control:} & Drone operation state; manual and automatic \\&\\
     \textbf{Initial State:} & The starting point for the test \\&\\
     \textbf{Input:} & The variables to include in the test case \\&\\
     \textbf{Output:} & The result that should be achieved \\&\\
     \textbf{How test will be performed:} & The procedures taken for the duration of the test \\&\\
     \textbf{Test case derivation:} & The possible errors that will be included in the test cases \\&\\
     \textbf{Purpose of test:} & The reason why the test was performed and whether it fits the intended purpose \\&\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

There are also multiple objectives to be accomplished in the project for the proper operation of the drone to allow it to meet its set criteria. The following objectives will mainly focus on the most important qualities of the objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Software Algorithm Correctness: The drone should be able to operate according to its specifications, and the application to be used by the operators should be able to accurately relay the commands to the drone.
    \item Hardware Correctness: The components of the drone function properly according to their intended purpose and with minimal or no errors.
    \item State Machine Implementation: Include control events for the various components of the drone in order to operate those specific parts individually.
    \item Operator PC and Drone Communications: The components on the drone can accurately communicate with the operator application and cover the entire parking lot during the entire process that the drone is functioning.
    \item Safety Features: The drone has a backup or failsafe code in the situation where any of its parts are malfunctioning or prior to it.
    \item Ease of Use: The operator should be able to properly understand how to operate the drone from the application, under the circumstances that we assume they only have basic knowledge of operating computers.
\end{itemize}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

In the remaining portion of the document, there will be various sources of information that will help verify the process for the project. The major source will include the reference of the SRS document, while the minority of the documents will involve code files and design documents.

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You

\section{Plan}

This section outlines the various methods that the team will use to verify and validate the components of the system. This includes verifying the SRS, design, VnV plan, and implementation. Automated testing and verification tools will also be presented to aid in the iterative verification process. Finally, methods for validating that the system solves the problem will be presented.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

<<<<<<< HEAD
The members of the team are assigned an area of testing, where the area of testing is not their area of expertise. This ensures that the creator and tester are not the same person, which eliminates the bias that occurs when testing their own components. The assigned person to the testing area are then responsible for managing all tests in that domain. In the cases where a test covers multiple domains, the test will be conducted in a joint manner between the different domains. The assignment of the testing areas are indicated within \nameref{VnV_Team}.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

To verify the SRS, both formal and informal processes will be conducted. To test the completeness of the Finite State Machine (FSM), a formal decision table shall be created and maintained. This process ensures that all transitions and external stimuli are accounted for, in addition to identifying any states that cannot be reached or cannot be exited. The initial decision table has already been created within the SRS, located in [here]. To verify that the decision table is accurate as the project progresses, this table will be updated with any changes to the FSM. 

To informally verify the other components of the SRS, guided reviews and a checklist shall be conducted. The guided review will consist of the team explaining the Functional Requirements to a technical external party, and the external party will list any potential NFRs that are related to the FR. The team shall then ensure that the NFR is present within the SRS. Furthermore, the team shall have other capstone groups review the SRS using the provided rubric as guidelines for the review. The last method is to conduct a checklist, conducted either internally within the team or by an external party. The checklist is as follows: 

\begin{todolist}
\label{SRS_Checklist}
\item For each requirement within the SRS, are the following met?
\begin{todolist}
    \item Does the requirement address a specific goal?
    \item Is the requirement unique? 
    \item Is the requirement abstract?
    \item Is the requirement traceable?
    \item Is the requirement complete?
    \item Is the requirement measurable?
    \item Are there no inputs that are not used in the determination of the output? 
    \item Does each output use at least one input, and are all required inputs listed?
\end{todolist}
\item Does the Finite State Machine comply with the following?
\begin{todolist}
    \item Are all states unique?
    \item Are all states complete, and should not be combined or split into multiple states?
    \item Are all error states included?
    \begin{todolist}
        \item Are all data exceptions accounted for?
        \item Are error logging and recovery mechanisms present?
    \end{todolist}
    \item Are all transitions mutually exclusive?
    \item Are all state names meaningful and representative of the state?
\end{todolist}
\end{todolist}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The team plans to verify the design through structured review processes and a checklist. The review shall consist of the team explaining the product and design to an external party, and providing the external party with the FRs. They will then ensure that all the FRs are met, by using the checklist as a reference. The checklist is as follows, with additional detail on the requirements available in the [SRS]:

\end{todolist}

Internally within the team, a more detailed checklist shall be conducted that includes all the requirements listed within the SRS. To exclude any biases from the creator of the modules, the creator and tester will not be the same when conducting this review. Therefore, the members listed within section [xx] will be responsible for reviewing the requirements within their section. This ensures that all the requirements are accounted for within the design. The full checklist consists of the checklist above, in addition to the following:

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The implementation shall be verified primarily by the tests outlined within sections [xx] and [xx]. These sections include a combination of static, dynamic, and stress tests to ensure that the system is meeting the requirements of the system. Furthermore, the team shall conduct a code walkthrough for the FSM implementation. Conducted within the team, the implementor of the FSM shall provide the code used, and explain the state and transitions implemented. Using just the code, the team shall then recreate the entire FSM model as shown within the SRS at [here]. This process ensures that the implementation of the FSM matches the required FSM exactly.  

The team shall also conduct code reviews of the changes before the changes are merged into the master branch within GitHub. This ensures that a peer review process is implemented as part of the GitHub management system and that the changes are correct. In addition to the code walkthroughs, automated testing and verification tools shall also be used to verify the implementation of the system, as outlined within Section [4.6]. 


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

<<<<<<< HEAD
The team shall implement a variety of tools to automate the testing and verification process. Discussed upon within the [Coding Standard Development Plan], the team shall use a common IDE within the team, with integrated linters for both Python and C++. This ensures that static analyzers and coding standards are implemented automatically by the IDE and linter. A unit testing framework shall also be used to aid in the testing of the modules. Due to the usage of ROS within the product, the team shall use GTest for C++ modules, UnitTest for Python modules, and RosTest for ROS specific modules and communication. These three frameworks directly integrate within the ROS workflow, allowing for automatic execution of these tests during the compilation of the ROS packages. To further aid in the compilation of the various ROS packages, CMake shall be used to automate and simplify the compilation process. In addition to these tools, the team shall also produce a custom testing framework to test the visual perception algorithms. The custom tool shall automate the process of feeding in hardcoded input images into the algorithm, and record the algorithm outputs within a CSV file for easy manipulation and analysis of the outputs. 
=======
\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The system shall be verified by two main methods. A guided review process shall be conducted by an external party, where the team provides and explains the FRs to the external party. They will then determine what the problem statement is, without the actual problem statement being provided by the team. This ensures that the SRS solves the given problem. To verify that the SRS has been met, the [srs verification] will be used. To further test the functionality of the visual perception, open source datasets shall be used, in addition to the testing methods outlined within section [4.6]. Two open source datasets will be used: the Blanderbuss dataset and the CNRPark dataset. Sample images of these datasets are shown within Figures \ref{BlanderbussSample} and \ref{CNRParkSample}. These datasets will then verify the performance of the system with regards to the parking lot detection and occupancy in a variety of different conditions.

Initial State & The product is in its Off state.\nameref{SRS:TRANS_004} \nameref{SRS:PERF_007} \\ 
\hline
Input & Enter the configure state and set the hover height parameters to be the smallest values possible value \ref{Min_Hover_Params}. Afterward, launch the drone in normal operation and wait for 1 min 25 sec. \\ 
\hline
Output & From the moment of launch, it should take less than 25 seconds to reach and hover within 7+-1.5 m. While hovering, the drone should laterally stay within a 1.5 m radius of the launch location, and it should stay within 5.5m and 8.5m above the ground at all times. \\ 
\hline
How the test will be performed & 
The first step of the test, configuring height parameters, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item Setting the input i\_Mode as Configure and turning the power switch of the drone to On.
    \item Assert m\_Launch, so the drone enters the Configure state.
    \item Setting the height parameters in the Operator's PC Application to \ref{Min_Hover_Params}.
\end{enumerate}
The second step of the drone, having the drone enter and stay within the hover state, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Turning the power switch on the drone off.Then Setting i\_Mode as Normal and turning the power switch on, so the drone enters  Idle state.
	\item Placing the drone in a non-parking lot area. 
	\item Asserting m\_Launch as true, then wait for 25 sec.
	\item Wait for 1 min. During this wait measure the output variables.
\end{enumerate}
Once the output variables have been measured and the test is complete:
Assert m_Land to true, so that drone will enter the land state.\\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the smallest possible height parameters are \ref{Min_Hover_Params}. 

As per SRS, the drone should take less than 25 seconds to reach i\_MaxHoverHeight (7+-1.5 m) from the moment the drone launches. This is why the input steps specify a 25-second wait after launch.

As per SRS, while in the Hover state, the drone will enter the Autonomous Explore state if it sees a parking lot. The purpose of placing the drone in a non-parking lot area was to keep the drone in the Hover state.

While hovering the drone should stay within a 1.5 m radius. In terms of height, it means that the drone should hover within i\_MaxHoverHeight-1.5m=7-1.5=5.5m and i\_MaxHoverHeight+1.5m=7+1.5=8.5m above the ground.  
\\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests & This verifies the configure state can change flight parameters in accordance with the restrictions specified in the SRS. 
Elucidates how the drone operates in a non-parking lot area.
Verifies that the drone's flight dynamics are accurate, to the point that it can fly at the minimum height while maintaining minimum height safety requirements.

\hline
Initial State & The product is in its Off state.
 \\ 
\hline
Input & Enter the configure state and set the hover height parameters to be \ref{Med_Hover_Params}. Afterward, launch the drone in normal operation wait for 1 min 25 sec. \\ 
\hline
Output & The drone should take less than 25 seconds to reach and hover within 7+-1.5 m from the moment the drone launches. While hovering, the drone should laterally stay within a 1.5 m radius of the launch location, and it should stay within 18.5m and 21.5m above the ground at all times. 
 \\ 
\hline
How test will be performed &
The first step of the test, configuring height parameters, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item Setting the input i\_Mode as Configure and turning the power switch of the drone to On.
    \item Assert m\_Launch, so the drone enters the Configure state.
    \item Setting the height parameters in the Operator's PC Application to \ref{Med_Hover_Params}.
\end{enumerate}
The second step of the drone, having the drone enter and stay within the hover state, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Turning the power switch on the drone off.Then Setting i\_Mode as Normal and turning the power switch on, so the drone enters  Idle state.
	\item Placing the drone in a non-parking lot area. 
	\item Asserting m\_Launch as true, then wait for 25 sec.
	\item Wait for 1 min. During this wait measure the output variables.
\end{enumerate}
Once the output variables have been measured and the test is complete:
Assert m_Land to true, so that drone will enter the land state.\\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the drone should take less then 25 seconds to reach i\_MaxHoverHeight (20+-1.5 m) from the moment the drone launches. This is why the input steps specify a 25 second wait after launch.

As per SRS, while in the Hover state, the drone will enter the Autonomous Explore state if it sees a parking lot. The purpose of placing the drone in a non-parking lot area was to keep the drone in the Hover state.

While hovering the drone should stay a 1.5 m radius. In terms of height, it means that the drone should hover within i\_MaxHoverHeight-1.5m=20-1.5=18.5m and i\_MaxHoverHeight+1.5m=20+1.5=21.5m above the ground.  \\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests & This test is very similar to test case 1, except that the height parameters are configured to be much higher. The purpose of configuring the height parameters differently is to verify that the drone can hover accurately at different heights, that the drone can land safely from different heights, and that the Configure state is actually capable of configuring the height variables.

Verifies the states Off, Idle, Hover, Configure and Land as well as the transitions between them. In particular, it verifies NFR requiring the drone to staying within a 1.5m radius within the hover state. 
Verifies a corner case in the parking lot detection algorithm, that it correctly detects no parking lot when there is no parking lot.
Elucidates how the drone operates in a non-parking lot area.
Verifies the NFR requiring the product to takeoff to i\_MaxHoverHeight within 25 seconds. \\

At some point the battery will be running very low (less then 1.5 minutes of flight left) and the drone will automatically enter the Malfunction state. In this state an error message will be logged to c\_Log, the c\_HealthStatus is set to Unhealthy, and the drone returns to the launch location. \\ 
\hline
How test will be performed & Regarding the initial state, verifying that the battery capacity is full can be accomplished by using the battery's charger. Input steps are self explanatory. \\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the Malfunction state must send an error message to c\_Log, change the c\_HealthStatus is set to Unhealthy, and the drone returns to the launch location.
As per HA, the drone must enter the Malfunction state and land itself when the battery left is detected as low (less then 1.5 minutes). As per SRS, the drone must have a total battery capacity of lasting at least 5 minutes, leading to at least 3.5 minutes of flight.
As per HA, the drone must display the amount of battery remaining to the operator.

Output & The drone should enter the Manual Move state upon a change to m\_DesiredUserLoc. The drone should move to and stay within 1.5m radially of the specified location. 
The user should also see a visual trace of the drone's movement; it should be a roughly straight line (shortest path).
Measure the time takes to reach the specified GPS location and calculate average speed and ensure it is more then 4 m/sec.  \\ 
\hline
How test will be performed & Input section contains enough detail. \\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the drone should enter Manual Move state whenever m\_DesiredUserLoc is changed and m\_CompulsiveMove is false. In this state the drone should travel to m\_DesiredUserLoc and hover with an accuracy of 1.5m. 

A visual trace of the drone's movement in the past 60 seconds should be displayed on the Operator's PC Application. It should appear as a relatively straight diagonal line toward the hover location, as the drone's path planning should make it take the shortest path. 

Using the time taken, the average speed of the drone can be calculated as distance/time. As per the SRS, it should be at least 4 m/sec. 
 \\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests & 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assesses the ability of the drone to move to forward as well as move rightward in a stable and efficient manner toward a specified GPS location.

  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}
