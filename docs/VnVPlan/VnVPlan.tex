\section{General Information}

The Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan outlines the various methods that the team will conduct to verify and validate the ParkingLotHawk. The general overview of the plan can be found in \nameref{vnvPlan}, with detailed tests outlined within \nameref{systemTest} and \nameref{unitTest}.

\subsection{Summary}

The ParkingLotHawk is an autonomous aerial drone that helps parking lot operators understand the state of their parking lot. The drone shall be able of full autonomy, where it automatically explores the parking lot, or by semi-autonomy, where the operator specifies the locations that the drone should go to. During flight, the drone shall transmit live information about the parking lot sections it detects, and display this information to the operator. 

\subsection{Objectives}

There are multiple objectives to be accomplished for the proper operation of the drone. The following objectives will mainly focus on the most important qualities of the objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Software Algorithm Correctness: The drone should be able to operate according to its specifications, and the application to be used by the operators should be able to accurately relay the commands to the drone.
    \item Hardware Correctness: The components of the drone functions properly according to their intended purpose and with minimal to no errors.
    \item State Machine Implementation: Control events exist and are correct for the various components of the drone in order to operate those specific parts individually.
    \item Operator's PC and Drone Communication: The components on the drone can accurately communicate with the operator application and the communication is functional during the entire time that the drone is functioning within the parking lot.
    \item Safety Features: The drone has a backup or failsafe code in the situation where any of its parts are malfunctioning or prior to the malfunction.
    \item Ease of Use: The operator should be able to properly understand how to operate the drone from the application, under the assumption that they only have basic knowledge of operating computers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

In the remaining portion of the document, there will be various sources of information that will help verify the process for the product. The major sources will include the reference of the \href{https://github.com/icecap360/DroneCapstone/blob/master/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} and \href{https://github.com/icecap360/DroneCapstone/blob/master/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{HA} documents for the requirements, and the \href{https://github.com/icecap360/DroneCapstone/blob/master/docs/Design/MG/MG.pdf}{MG} and \href{https://github.com/icecap360/DroneCapstone/blob/master/docs/Design/MIS/MIS.pdf}{MIS} documents for the design.

\section{Plan}
\label{vnvPlan}

This section outlines the various methods that the team will use to verify and validate the components of the system. This includes verifying the SRS, design, VnV plan, and implementation. Automated testing and verification tools will also be presented to aid in the iterative verification process. Finally, methods for validating that the system solves the problem will be presented.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The members of the team are assigned an area of testing, where the area of testing is not their area of expertise. This ensures that the creator and tester are not the same person, which eliminates the bias that occurs when testing their own components. The assigned person to the testing area are then responsible for managing all tests in that domain. In the cases where a test covers multiple domains, the test will be conducted in a joint manner between the different domains. The assignment of the testing areas are indicated within \nameref{VnV_Team}.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
\label{SRSVerification}

To verify the SRS, both formal and informal processes will be conducted. To test the completeness of the FSM, a formal decision table shall be created and maintained. This process ensures that all transitions and external stimuli are accounted for, in addition to identifying any states that cannot be reached or cannot be exited. The initial decision table has already been created within the SRS, located in \nameref{appendixb}. To verify that the decision table is accurate as the project progresses, this table will be updated with any changes to the FSM. 

To informally verify the other components of the SRS, guided reviews and a checklist shall be conducted. The guided review will consist of the team explaining the Functional Requirements to a technical external party, and the external party will list any potential NFRs that are related to the FR. The team shall then ensure that the NFR is present within the SRS. Furthermore, the team shall have other capstone groups review the SRS using the provided rubric as guidelines for the review. The last method is to conduct a checklist, conducted either internally within the team or by an external party. The checklist is as follows: 

\begin{todolist}
\label{SRS_Checklist}
\item For each requirement within the SRS, are the following met?
\begin{todolist}
    \item Does the requirement address a specific goal?
    \item Is the requirement unique? 
    \item Is the requirement abstract?
    \item Is the requirement traceable?
    \item Is the requirement complete?
    \item Is the requirement measurable?
    \item Are there no inputs that are not used in the determination of the output? 
    \item Does each output use at least one input, and are all required inputs listed?
\end{todolist}
\item Does the Finite State Machine comply with the following?
\begin{todolist}
    \item Are all states unique?
    \item Are all states complete, and should not be combined or split into multiple states?
    \item Are all error states included?
    \begin{todolist}
        \item Are all data exceptions accounted for?
        \item Are error logging and recovery mechanisms present?
    \end{todolist}
    \item Are all transitions mutually exclusive?
    \item Are all state names meaningful and representative of the state?
\end{todolist}
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The team plans to verify the design through structured review processes and a checklist. The review shall consist of the team explaining the product and design to an external party, and providing the external party with the FRs. They will then ensure that all the FRs are met, by using the checklist as a reference. The checklist is as follows, with additional detail on the requirements available in \nameref{sec:funcReqs}:

    \item Upon m\_Land being true, the product shall enter the Land state.
    \item If c\_Connected becomes false for more than 5 seconds, or signal strength (dBm) has lost 80\% of its typical value at any point during operation, then the product shall enter the Communication Lost state.
    \item If while in the Communication Lost State, c\_Connected becomes true for more than 5 seconds, or signal strength (dBm) has returned to 50\% of its typical value at any point during operation, then the product shall enter the Hover state.
    \item Once the user enters or changes m\_DesiredUserLoc and m\_CompulsiveMove is asserted as true, the drone shall automatically enter the Compulsive Move state.
\end{todolist}
\end{todolist}

Internally within the team, a more detailed checklist shall be conducted that includes all the requirements listed within the SRS. To exclude any biases from the creator of the modules, the creator and tester will not be the same when conducting this review. Therefore, the members listed within section [xx] will be responsible for reviewing the requirements within their section. This ensures that all the requirements are accounted for within the design. The full checklist consists of the checklist above, in addition to the following:

\end{todolist}
\end{todolist}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The Verification and Validation Plan shall be verified through an informal peer review process and a checklist. The peer review shall be conducted by another technical Capstone group and will use the provided rubric as a guideline. The checklist can then be conducted either internally within the team, or by an external party. The checklist is as follows, and ensures that all components of the VnV Plan are present: 

\begin{todolist}
\label{VnV_Checklist}
\item Are methods outlined to verify the SRS and the requirements within it?
\begin{todolist}
    \item Are all requirements covered by system tests?
\end{todolist}
\item Are methods outlined to verify the design?
\item Are methods outlined to verify the implementation of the design?
\item Are automated testing and verification tools clearly outlined and feasible?
\item Are methods outlined to validate the design and ensure that it solves the problem statement?
\item Are all methods outlined in the VnV Plan feasible, given the current resources available for VnV?
\item Is there traceability between the test plans and the requirements?
\item Are tests outlined specifically and clearly, such that they can be reproduced by an external party?
\end{todolist}


\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The implementation shall be verified primarily by the tests outlined within sections [xx] and [xx]. These sections include a combination of static, dynamic, and stress tests to ensure that the system is meeting the requirements of the system. Furthermore, the team shall conduct a code walkthrough for the FSM implementation. Conducted within the team, the implementor of the FSM shall provide the code used, and explain the state and transitions implemented. Using just the code, the team shall then recreate the entire FSM model as shown within the SRS at [here]. This process ensures that the implementation of the FSM matches the required FSM exactly.  

The team shall also conduct code reviews of the changes before the changes are merged into the master branch within GitHub. This ensures that a peer review process is implemented as part of the GitHub management system and that the changes are correct. In addition to the code walkthroughs, automated testing and verification tools shall also be used to verify the implementation of the system, as outlined within \nameref{automatedVerificationTools}. 


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\label{automatedVerificationTools}

The team shall implement a variety of tools to automate the testing and verification process. Discussed upon within the \nameref{codingStandard}, the team shall use a common IDE within the team, with integrated linters for both Python and C++. This ensures that static analyzers and coding standards are implemented automatically by the IDE and linter. A unit testing framework shall also be used to aid in the testing of the modules. Due to the usage of ROS within the product, the team shall use GTest for C++ modules, UnitTest for Python modules, and RosTest for ROS specific modules and communication. These three frameworks directly integrate within the ROS workflow, allowing for automatic execution of these tests during the compilation of the ROS packages. To further aid in the compilation of the various ROS packages, CMake shall be used to automate and simplify the compilation process. In addition to these tools, the team shall also produce a custom testing framework to test the visual perception algorithms. The custom tool shall automate the process of feeding in hardcoded input images into the algorithm, and record the algorithm outputs within a CSV file for easy manipulation and analysis of the outputs. 

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The system shall be verified by two main methods. A guided review process shall be conducted by an external party, where the team provides and explains the FRs to the external party. They will then determine what the problem statement is, without the actual problem statement being provided by the team. This ensures that the SRS solves the given problem. To verify that the SRS has been met, the \nameref{SRSVerification} will be used. To further test the functionality of the visual perception, open source datasets shall be used, in addition to the testing methods outlined within \nameref{automatedVerificationTools}. Two open source datasets will be used: the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blanderbuss/parking-lot-dataset}{Blanderbuss dataset} and the \href{http://cnrpark.it/}{CNRPark dataset}. Sample images of these datasets are shown within Figures \ref{BlanderbussSample} and \ref{CNRParkSample}. These datasets will then verify the performance of the system with regards to the parking lot detection and occupancy in a variety of different conditions.

\section{System Test Description}
\label{systemTest}
The proceeding section outlines detailed system tests that verify the implementation of the system.

\subsection{Measuring Outputs Testing}

There are several ways to measure the output variables. Some suggestions are given in the following section. 

In general, given that all output variables can be viewed using the Operator's Application, this is perhaps the easiest source to measure the drone's response. There are special systems and unit tests to verify if the Operator's Application is correctly displaying/gathering the output variable.

Another method of viewing output variables is to print and store the output variables in log files within the onboard drone computer's file system. They can then be collected or sent to the Operator's PC to analyze the logs later.

To collect time statistics, either the timer on the embedded computer can be used and printed in log files, or one can use an external manual timer.

For all test cases, to measure location and height, the GPS location and height displayed on the Operator's PC Application can be used, except for the Flight Dynamics Tests \ref{flightdynamicsTests}, in these scenarios an external location and height measurement tool must be used. Examples to measure lateral location include adding an external and light GPS to the drone or walking underneath the drone with an external GPS (like the ones on smart phones). To measure height one may use marks on a wall, or even attach a rope to the drone.

\subsection{Assumptions Regarding Test Cases}
Unless otherwise stated, the test case requires that there is enough battery to complete the test case.
Unless the creation of special stubs is specified, the drone is assumed to be complete mechanically, electrically, and software-wise. 

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The test cases were designed to for coverage over all the requirements that needed testing for verification. Requirements are grouped into the system component that is most difficult or most central to the task. However there is overlap between the test case categories, for example, the User Error Test Cases \ref{usererrorTests} utilize the Visual Perception component to make decisions/transitions.

\subsubsection{Flight Dynamics}
\label{flightdynamicsTests}

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{ | m{1.5cm} | m{15cm} | } 
\hline
ID & \nameref{tab:STC_001} \\ 
\hline
Control & Manual \\ 
\hline
Initial State & The product is in its Off state. \\ 
\hline
Input & Enter the configure state and set \ref{Indoor_Hover_Params}. Afterwards, launch the drone in normal operation and wait for 1 min 25 sec. \\ 
\hline
Output & The drone should take less than 25 seconds to reach and hover within 1 +- 0.5 m from the moment the drone launches. While hovering, the drone should laterally stay within a 1.5 m radius of the launch location. \\ 
\hline
How test will be performed & A stub must be created in the code to suppress the requirement of the hover parameters being at least \ref{Min_Hover_Params}, as indoor conditions permit only a much lower flight height. 

The first step of the test, configuring height parameters, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item Setting the input i\_Mode as Configure and turning the power switch of the drone to On.
    \item Assert m\_Launch, so the drone enters the Configure state.
    \item Setting the height parameters in the Operator's PC Application to \ref{Indoor_Hover_Params}.
\end{enumerate}
The second step of the drone, having the drone enter and stay within the hover state, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Turning the power switch on the drone off. Then set i\_Mode as Normal and turn the power switch on, so the drone enters Idle state.
	\item Placing the drone in a non-parking lot area. 
	\item Asserting m\_Launch as true, then wait for 25 sec.
	\item Wait for 1 min. During this wait measure the output variables.
\end{enumerate}
Once the output variables have been measured and the test is complete, assert m_Land to true so the drone transitions to the land state.\\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, while in the Hover state, the drone will enter the Autonomous Explore state if it sees a parking lot. The purpose of placing the drone in a non-parking lot area was to keep the drone in the Hover state rather than entering the Autonomous Explore state.

While hovering the drone should stay within a 1.5 m radius laterally, without the presence of any external forces such as wind.

This test is an extension of STC_001, where this test is conducted within a controlled environment, and STC_001 is conducted within the actual environment with external forces. \\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests &  • Assesses and verifies the flight dynamics in an indoor scenario, which won't have the gusts and winds of outdoor test cases.

• Verifies the states Off, Idle, Hover, Configure and Land as well as the transitions between them (\nameref{STA_000}, \nameref{STA_001}, \nameref{STA_004}, \nameref{STA_005}, \nameref{STA_006}, \nameref{TRANS_002}, \nameref{TRANS_003}, \nameref{TRANS_009}).

• Verifies a corner case in the parking lot detection algorithm, that it correctly detects no parking lot when there is no parking lot (\nameref{GEN_001}).

• Elucidates how the drone operates in a non-parking lot area.

Initial State & The product is in its Off state. \\ 
\hline
Input & Enter the configure state and set the hover height parameters to be the smallest values possible value \ref{Min_Hover_Params}. Afterward, launch the drone in normal operation and wait for 1 min 25 sec. \\ 
\hline
Output & From the moment of launch, it should take less than 25 seconds to reach and hover within 7+-1.5 m. While hovering, the drone should laterally stay within a 1.5 m radius of the launch location, and it should stay within 5.5m and 8.5m above the ground at all times. \\ 
\hline
How the test will be performed & 
The first step of the test, configuring height parameters, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item Setting the input i\_Mode as Configure and turning the power switch of the drone to On.
    \item Assert m\_Launch, so the drone enters the Configure state.
    \item Setting the height parameters in the Operator's PC Application to \ref{Min_Hover_Params}.
\end{enumerate}
The second step of the drone, having the drone enter and stay within the hover state, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Turning the power switch on the drone off. Then Setting i\_Mode as Normal and turning the power switch on so the drone enters the Idle state.
	\item Placing the drone in a non-parking lot area. 
	\item Asserting m\_Launch as true, then wait for 25 sec.
	\item Wait for 1 min. During this wait, measure the output variables.
\end{enumerate}
Once the output variables have been measured and the test is complete:
Assert m\_Land to true so that drone will enter the land state.\\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the smallest possible height parameters are \ref{Min_Hover_Params}. 

As per SRS, the drone should take less than 25 seconds to reach i\_MaxHoverHeight (7+-1.5 m) from the moment the drone launches. This is why the input steps specify a 25-second wait after launch.

Also, if the drone sees a parking lot in the Hover state, it must enter the Autonomous Explore state. To prevent this transition, a non-parking lot area is selected.

While hovering, the drone should stay within a 1.5m lateral radius, with a height within i\_MaxHoverHeight-1.5m=7-1.5=5.5m and i\_MaxHoverHeight+1.5m=7+1.5=8.5m above the ground.  
\\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests & This verifies that the configure state can change flight parameters in accordance with the restrictions specified in the SRS (\nameref{GEN_003}, \nameref{GEN_004}).
Elucidates how the drone operates in a non-parking lot area.

\hline
Initial State & The product is in its Off state.
 \\ 
\hline
Input & Enter the configure state and set the hover height parameters to be \ref{Med_Hover_Params}. Afterward, launch the drone in normal operation and wait for 1 min 25 sec. \\ 
\hline
Output & The drone should take less than 25 seconds to reach and hover within 7+-1.5 m from the moment the drone launches. While hovering, the drone should laterally stay within a 1.5 m radius of the launch location, and it should stay within 18.5m and 21.5m above the ground at all times. 
 \\ 
\hline
How test will be performed &
The first step of the test, configuring height parameters, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item Setting the input i\_Mode as Configure and turning the power switch of the drone to On.
    \item Assert m\_Launch, so the drone enters the Configure state.
    \item Setting the height parameters in the Operator's PC Application to \ref{Med_Hover_Params}.
\end{enumerate}
The second step of the drone, having the drone enter and stay within the hover state, is accomplished by:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Turning the power switch on the drone off. Then set i\_Mode as Normal and turn the power switch on, so the drone enters Idle state.
	\item Placing the drone in a non-parking lot area. 
	\item Asserting m\_Launch as true, then wait for 25 sec.
	\item Wait for 1 min. During this wait measure the output variables.
\end{enumerate}
Once the output variables have been measured and the test is complete:
Assert m\_Land to true, so that drone will enter the land state.\\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the drone should take less than 25 seconds to reach i\_MaxHoverHeight (20+-1.5 m) from the moment the drone launches. This is why the input steps specify a 25 sec wait after launch.

As per SRS, while in the Hover state, the drone will enter the Autonomous Explore state if it sees a parking lot. The purpose of placing the drone in a non-parking lot area is to keep the drone in the Hover state.

While hovering the drone should stay a 1.5 m radius. In terms of height, it means that the drone should hover within i\_MaxHoverHeight-1.5m=20-1.5=18.5m and i\_MaxHoverHeight+1.5m=20+1.5=21.5m above the ground.  \\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests & This test is very similar to \nameref{tab:STC_001}, except that the height parameters are configured to be much higher. The purpose of configuring the height parameters differently is to verify that the drone can hover accurately at different heights, that the drone can land safely from different heights, and that the Configure state is actually capable of configuring the height variables (\nameref{GEN_003}, \nameref{GEN_004}).

Verifies the states Off, Idle, Hover, Configure, and Land as well as the transitions between them (\nameref{STA_000}, \nameref{STA_001}, \nameref{STA_004}, \nameref{STA_005}, \nameref{STA_006}, \nameref{TRANS_002}, \nameref{TRANS_003}, \nameref{TRANS_009}). 
Verifies a corner case in the parking lot detection algorithm where it correctly detects no parking lot when there is no parking lot.
Verifies the NFR requiring the product to take off to i\_MaxHoverHeight within 25 seconds (\nameref{PERF_002}). \\

A visual trace of the drone's movement in the past 60 seconds should be displayed on the Operator's PC Application. It should appear as a relatively straight diagonal line toward the hover location, as the drone's path planning should make it take the shortest path.

As per SRS, the drone should enter the Communication Lost state when communication is lost for more than 5 sec. The Communication Lost state must log an error to c_Log, set c_HealthStatus to Unhealthy, and move back toward the launch location. Communication is likely to be lost as the m_DesiredUserLoc is very far (2km).

Within this state, the SRS specifies that the drone should inform the user that their movement command is not possible (through a message in c\_Log), and begin hovering in place.

A visual trace of the drone's movement in the past 60 seconds should be displayed on the Operator's PC Application. It should appear as a relatively straight line toward the hover location, as the drone's path planning should make it take the shortest path.

\hline
Output & Upon the first attempt to enter the Autonomous Explore State, the attempt should fail, and instead, the drone should enter the No Parking Lot Detected State. Upon entrance to this state, c\_UserError is set to No_Lot_Detected_State and an error message is logged to c\_Log. Afterward, when the drone enters the Compulsive move state, c\_UserError should be None, and the drone should travel to m\_DesiredUserLoc. Upon the second attempt to enter the Autonomous Explore State, the attempt should succeed. \\

How test will be performed & 
The test case can be restated in terms of the input and output variables: 
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Assert m\_AutonomousExplore as true to request the Autonomous Explore state. Measure/analyze behavior. 
	\item Now assert and hold m\_CompulsiveMove as true, and change m\_DesiredUserLoc to a location within the nearby parking lot. 
	\item Wait until the drone is within 1.5m of the m\_DesiredUserLoc
	\item Try setting m\_AutonomousExplore to true again to request entrance in the parking lot. Measure/analyze behavior.  \end{enumerate} \\
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS the Autonomous Explore state should only be entered if c\_ParkingLotDetected is true. The Initial State behavior specified above (height parameters and distance to nearby parking lot) is set in a way to ensure that the nearby parking lot is not in the field of view of the drone. This is why the first attempt to enter the Autonomous Explore fails while the second attempt succeeds. When an attempt to enter Autonomous Explore fails, the drone should enter the No Parking Lot Detected State.

As per SRS, upon entrance into the No Parking Lot Detected State c\_UserError should be set to No_Lot_Detected_State and an error message is should be logged to c\_Log. Upon exit \c_UserError should be set to None.

As per SRS, the Compulsive Move state should be entered if the m\_DesiredUserLoc is changed and m\_CompulsiveMove is true. 
 \\

This includes the parking lot slot identifications, the occupancy map, and the parking lot bounds. To ensure repeatability in this test, hard-coded inputs are used instead of the real environment. This prevents any changes to the environment from affecting the results of this test.  \\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests &  • Verifies the pipeline that communicates outputs from the visual perception feature to the Operator's PC application.

• Helps to gauge the accuracy and performance of the visual perception on datasets of varying weather, number of vehicles, types of vehicles, camera height, etc. By using hardcoded datasets, the perception algorithms create  consistency between tests, as different versions of the algorithm can be compared on the same inputs.

• Verifies the ability to recognize clear boundaries (\nameref{GEN_001}).

• Verifies the live updating of the c_OccupancyMap (\nameref{GEN_002}).

• Verifies the ability to identify non-occupied parking spots (\nameref{Gen_005}, \nameref{SR_009}).

• Verifies display of non-occupied parking spots on the Operator's application (\nameref{GEN_006}).

Initial State & The drone is in the Automatic Explore state within the 3D Software in the Loop (SITL) environment. \\ 
\hline
Input & Position the drone within a custom-made 3D SITL environment. Send the drone to the Hover state and transition to the Automatic Explore state. \\ 
\hline
Output & The drone should output c\_CurrentView, c\_OccupencyMap, and c\_ParkingLotDetected. c\_CurrentView should feature the input image with overlays for the parking lot slots and the boundaries of the parking lot. c\_OccupencyMap should indicate all visible parking lots, and whether each parking lot is occupied or not. c\_ParkingLotDetected should be true. The specific outputs will be determined by which input image is being passed in.

Furthermore, the current positions of the drone should be outputted to the Operator's application: c\_CurrentLoc and c\_PastLoc. \\ 
\hline
How test will be performed & A custom-made SITL environment consisting of 6 rows of parking slots, with 10 slots per row, will be created with Gazebo. 25\% of the parking slots will be occupied by vehicles. An external script will be used to start the SITL setup with the premade scenario and execute the required sequence of inputs to bring the drone to the Autonomous Explore state. c\_CurrentView for the entire test will be saved as a .avi file, and the remaining outputs will be exported to a CSV for analysis. The test ends when either the entire parking lot has been explored, or until 3.5 minutes has passed since the drone's initial launch.
 \\ 
\hline
Test case derivation & As per SRS, the drone should process the visual input from the camera to determine the parking lot information and display that information to the Operator's application. This test is similar to STC_014, but this test is within a closed loop environment, whereas STC_014 is with an open loop system. Furthermore, this tests the path planning algorithm specified within the SRS.
 \\ 
\hline
Purpose of test and/or relationship to other tests &  • Usage of the 3D SITL allows the verification of the path planning algorithm, visual perception algorithm, and the integration between them on consistent test cases.

• Verifies the ability to recognize clear boundaries (\nameref{GEN_001}).

• Verifies the live updating of the c_OccupancyMap, c_CurrentLoc, and c_CurrentView (\nameref{GEN_002}).

• Verifies ability to identify non-occupied parking spots (\nameref{GEN_005}).

• Verifies display of non-occupied parking spots onto the Operator's application (\nameref{GEN_006}).

• Verifies the Autonomous Explore state (\nameref{STA_003}, \nameref{TRANS_003}).
