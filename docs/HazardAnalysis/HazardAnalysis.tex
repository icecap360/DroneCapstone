\section{Introduction}

Safety is a key feature of almost all products and services used. In order to determine safety features, a Hazard Analysis is typically done to generate, understand, and resolve key hazards that may come up during operations. For this document, a hazard is defined as a property or condition within the physical or virtual constraints of the system, together with a condition in the environment that has the potential to cause harm or damage. A Hazard Analysis of the ParkingLotHawk is presented in this document. 

%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%
\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of the Hazard Analysis is to find, understand and finalize resolutions to the various hazards that may occur.  

The product, ParkingLotHawk, is an autonomous aerial drone used to gather live images and data within the confines of any given outdoor parking lot.  The user of such a product is the Parking Lot Operator (called Operator for short), who communicates with the Aerial Drone using an application running on their PC.

The scope of this Hazard Analysis is related to hazards that occur when the Parking Lot Operator is using the final product in the typical real-world use case: investigating an outdoor parking lot. For example, Hazards related to the development and prototyping of the product are not analyzed in this document. 

The document starts by breaking the system into components, followed by identifying hazards for each component using the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method, and then finally generates new safety requirements to resolve the various hazards. This method will help minimize any unsafe behavior in the system by finding any possible causes of the said failure and determining the proper response for it.

%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------System Boundaries and Components --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%
\section{System Boundaries and Components}
\label{SystemBoundaries}
The systems referenced in this document for conducting ParkingLotHawkâ€™s hazard analysis are defined within the \nameref{tab:SystemComp}:

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\caption {System Components Table} 
\label{tab:SystemComp}
\begin{tabular}{ | m{4 cm} | m{12 cm} | } 
\hline
Components & Description \\
\hline
Main Drone Application & The Main Drone Application contains an implementation of the Finite State Machines specified in the Software Requirements Specification. This component also communicates with the Operator's PC Application to receive user commands and send relevant parking lot information.\\
\hline
Flight Operations & This component is responsible for calculating the optimal propeller speeds to stabilize and move the drone in accordance with movement commands from the Main Application. This component consists of the flight controller hardware, the external sensors it uses, and firmware that is flashed onto the flight controller board. Internal sensors include the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for estimating acceleration and angular rate, a compass for orientation, and a barometer for atmospheric pressure to determine the altitude. External sensors include the Global Positioning System (GPS), used to locate the drone's position. \\
\hline
Vision Perception & The Vision Perception component consists of a camera and the algorithm for detecting parking spots, making an occupancy map of the lot, and segmenting the boundaries of the parking lot. It outputs live images from that camera for the user interface to display to the operator, and outputs and detections of whether it currently sees a parking lot which is used by the user interface to create an occupancy map. \\
\hline
Path Planner & This software component is used for autonomous exploration; it creates a path to explore the parking lot. Its outputs are used by the Main Drone Application. \\
\hline
Thrust Components & The Thrust Component is responsible for spinning the propellers at the speed commanded by the Flight Operations component. The component consists of motors, propellers, and Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs).\\
\hline
Frame & The Frame will hold all the physical pieces of the drone together.\\
\hline
Power Modules & The Power Modules will power components within the drone such as the flight controller and motors. The components consist of a battery, charging equipment, switches, and wires.\\
\hline
Operator's PC Application & This component is what the Operator interfaces with to get the drone up and running, in addition to how the Operator obtains the information provided by the drone. This component communicates with the Main Application running on the physical drone to send user commands and receive relevant parking lot information. \\

%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------Critical Assumptions --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%


\section{Critical Assumptions}
There are several assumptions that help to solve and sometimes even eliminate hazards all together. Firstly, it is assumed that the Parking Lot Operator utilizing the drone has completely read the User Manual and that they utilize the drone in the way specified by the User Manual. For example, if the User Manual specifies weather conditions under which the drone should not be flown, it is assumed that the user does not fly the drone in these inclement weather conditions. Secondly, it is assumed that the Operator uses the drone solely for parking lot investigation, not for activities such as recreation, spying, etc.  



%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------Failure Mode and Effect Analysis --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%
\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

The analysis of the components outlined within \nameref{SystemBoundaries} are provided through FMEA tables below, with the associated Safety Requirements attached to any applicable hazards.

The Severity, Occurance, and Detection are ranked on linear scales of 10, with 10 being the most severe. RPN then provides a combined score for the hazard, with higher RPNs being more hazardous.

With regards to H\_001 and H\_002, the redundant sensor will be implemented in the same way as the primary, but the sensor will be selected to provide increased robustness at the cost of accuracy. If the primary sensor has a variance above a threshold, calculated through the Extended Kalman Filter, the secondary sensor will be used instead. If the secondary sensor also produces unacceptable variances, then the drone will enter the Malfunction State.

Similarly for H\_003, the height readings from the barometer will be crosschecked with the IMU readings on the Z axis. If the variance between the sensors exceed a threshold for a specified amount of time, then the drone will enter the Malfunction State.

Description & On the user interface's satellite map, the product shall highlight the parking lot boundaries. On the live drone camera video feed, the drone should annotate the raw images with segmentations of parking lot vs non-parking lot to the Operator's application. \\
\hline
Rationale & The requirement ensures that the Operator is aware of how the product is perceiving its environment and can determine if the product's perception of its environment is correct or incorrect. \\

Description & The product shall automatically return to its original launch location and land once the estimated battery time is less than 1.5 minutes. \\
\hline
Rationale & The requirement ensures that the product has sufficient battery left to safely return to its landing area and land, all while remaining within its specifications. \\

Description & The product shall inform the user if the battery capacity before launch is estimated to be less than 2.5 minutes of flight, and prevent launch of the product. \\
\hline
Rationale & The requirement ensures that the product is not used with excessively worn out batteries, to the extent that it cannot operate within its specifications. \\

\section{Roadmap}

The safety requirements will be implemented through 4 main phases, and are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase I: Proof of Concept - November 14, 2022
    \item Phase II: Revision 0 (Minimal Viable Product (MVP) ) - February 6, 2023 
    \item Phase III: Revision 1 - March 27, 2023
    \item Phase IV: Revision 2 - April 27, 2023
\end{itemize}

The requirements will be implemented within the respective phase as listed in Table \ref{SR_Roadmap}.
