\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of the Hazard Analysis is to find, understand and finalize resolutions to the various hazards that may occur.

The product, ParkingLotHawk, is an Autonomous Aerial Drone used to gather live images and data within the confines of any given outdoor parking lot. The data in drone records the situation of each parking space periodically, and the information would be sent to the user staying on the property in a timely manner. The user of such a product is the Parking Lot Operator (called Operator for short), who communicates with the Aerial Drone using an application running on their PC.

The document starts by breaking the system into components, followed by identifying hazards for each component using the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method, and then finally generating new safety requirements to resolve the various hazards. This method will help minimize any unsafe behavior in the system by finding any possible causes of the said failure and determining the proper response for it.

%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------System Boundaries and Components --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------Critical Assumptions --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%


\section{Critical Assumptions}
There are several assumptions that help to solve and sometimes even eliminate hazards all together. Firstly, it is assumed that the Parking Lot Operator utilizing the Drone has completely read the User Manual, and that they utilize the drone in the way specified by the user Manual. For example, if the User Manual specifies weather conditions under which the drone should not be flown, it is assumed that the user then does not fly the drone in these inclement weather conditions. Secondly, it is assumed that the operator uses the drone solely for parking lot investigation, not for activities such as recreation, spying, etc.  


%%%%%%%% --------------------------------------------Failure Mode and Effect Analysis --------------------------------------------%%%%%%%%
